# Security Changes for Chrome Web Store Publishing

## Overview of Changes

We've implemented a backend server to securely handle Firebase authentication and operations, keeping API keys and credentials secure when publishing to the Chrome Web Store.

## Key Changes

1. **Backend Server**
   - Created an Express.js server to handle Firebase operations
   - Moved Firebase API keys and credentials to the backend
   - Implemented proper CORS protection to restrict access to our extension

2. **API Service**
   - Created a new API service to communicate with the backend
   - Updated all Firebase operations to use the backend API
   - Added fallback mechanisms for offline operation

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Removed sensitive information from frontend .env file
   - Added backend .env file with proper security measures
   - Created setup script for service account configuration

4. **Authentication Flow**
   - Authentication still happens in the frontend using Firebase Auth
   - Backend verifies Firebase ID tokens for secure API access
   - Added token-based authorization for all API endpoints

## Security Benefits

1. **API Key Protection**
   - Firebase API keys are no longer exposed in client-side code
   - Service account credentials are securely stored on the server
   - CORS restrictions prevent unauthorized access to the backend

2. **Request Validation**
   - All API requests are validated on the server
   - Firebase ID tokens are verified for each protected endpoint
   - Input validation prevents malicious data

3. **Deployment Security**
   - Service account keys are excluded from Git repositories
   - Environment-specific configuration for development and production
   - Clear documentation for secure deployment

## How to Use

1. Set up the backend server following the instructions in `BACKEND_SETUP.md`
2. Update the extension's API base URL to point to your deployed backend
3. Build and publish the extension to the Chrome Web Store

## Additional Security Recommendations

1. **API Key Restrictions**
   - Restrict your Firebase API key to specific domains/origins
   - Set up Firebase Security Rules to control database access
   - Implement rate limiting on your backend server

2. **Regular Updates**
   - Keep dependencies updated to patch security vulnerabilities
   - Rotate service account keys periodically
   - Monitor backend logs for suspicious activity

3. **User Data Protection**
   - Implement proper data encryption for sensitive information
   - Follow data minimization principles
   - Provide clear privacy policy for users
