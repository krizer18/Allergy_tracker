    <h1>Allergy Tracker Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: July 2025</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Allergy Tracker is a Chrome extension designed to help users identify potential allergens in their Amazon Fresh cart items.
            This privacy policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and what choices you have regarding your data.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Allergy Tracker collects the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User Account Information:</strong> Email address for authentication purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Allergy Information:</strong> The allergies you add to your profile.</li>
            <li><strong>Scan Results:</strong> Information about products in your Amazon Fresh cart, including product titles, URLs, and ingredients.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To authenticate your identity and provide access to your saved allergies.</li>
            <li>To analyze product ingredients and identify potential allergens.</li>
            <li>To save your allergies and scan results for future reference.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
            Your data is stored in two locations:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> We store your allergies and user information in your browser's local storage for persistence between sessions.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Firestore:</strong> If you create an account, your allergies and scan results are also stored in our Firebase Firestore database to enable access across devices.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
            We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to outside parties. Your data is only used within the extension to provide the allergy tracking service.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Amazon Data Access</h2>
        <p>
            This extension accesses and processes information from Amazon.com product pages to extract ingredient information. We only access pages that you are actively viewing in your browser, and only when you explicitly request a scan of your cart.
