# Security Implementation for Allergy Tracker

## Overview

We've implemented a secure architecture for the Allergy Tracker Chrome Extension that protects API keys and user data when publishing to the Chrome Web Store.

## Security Features

1. **Backend Authentication Proxy**
   - All Firebase authentication operations now go through our backend server
   - Firebase API keys are stored securely on the server
   - Authentication tokens are managed securely

2. **Secure API Communication**
   - All API requests are authenticated with Firebase ID tokens
   - CORS restrictions prevent unauthorized access
   - Error handling for authentication failures

3. **Data Protection**
   - User data is stored securely in Firebase through the backend
   - Local storage is used as a fallback for offline operation
   - Tokens are refreshed automatically when needed

## Implementation Details

### Backend Server

The backend server provides these secure endpoints:

- `/api/signup` - Create new user accounts
- `/api/login` - Authenticate existing users
- `/api/google-auth` - Handle Google OAuth authentication
- `/api/token-refresh` - Refresh authentication tokens
- `/api/allergies` - Get and save user allergies
- `/api/scrape-results` - Get and save scrape results

### Frontend Authentication Service

The frontend uses a dedicated authentication service (`auth.ts`) that:

1. Manages user authentication state
2. Handles token storage and refresh
3. Provides a clean API for login, signup, and logout

### API Service

The API service (`api.ts`) uses the authentication service to:

1. Get authentication tokens for API requests
2. Make authenticated requests to the backend
3. Handle errors and provide fallbacks

## How to Verify Security

1. **Check Network Requests**
   - Open Chrome DevTools and go to the Network tab
   - Verify that authentication requests go to your backend, not directly to Firebase
   - Check that API requests include authentication tokens

2. **Inspect Extension Code**
   - Verify that no Firebase API keys are in the frontend code
   - Confirm that all sensitive operations use the backend API

3. **Test Authentication Flow**
   - Sign up for a new account
   - Log in with existing credentials
   - Try Google authentication
   - Verify that all operations work correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Google Authentication**
   - Implement full Google OAuth flow through the backend
   - Remove any remaining Firebase client SDK dependencies

2. **Token Management**
   - Implement automatic token refresh
   - Add token expiration handling

3. **Additional Security Measures**
   - Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Implement request validation
   - Add logging for security auditing
